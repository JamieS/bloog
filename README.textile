h1. Python Blog for "Google App Engine":http://appengine.google.com/, heavily \
tweaked from "Bill Katz' Bloog":http://github.com/DocSavage/bloog


h2. Instructions

Once you've checked out the code, initialize the external modules like so:

bc.  $ git submodule init

h3. Minified Resources

This version also uses minified JS and CSS resources in 'hosted' mode.  This allows 
you to make quick changes locally (and easily debug code with correct line numbers) \
while still serving content as quickly as possible to your visitors.  This means
 if you make changes to JS or CSS files, you /must/ run @dev/minify.sh@ before 
 updating your application using @appcfg@

h3. Locally Hosted Resources during Development

Sometimes I'm offline when doing development so YUI resources are served locally
 during development, but referenced from Yahoo's CDN when the app is hosted live.

Download the "latest build":http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/ and copy the 'build' 
 directory to @static/hosted/yui@

h3. Picasa Image Store

I've developed two modes of hosting uploaded images from Bloog - a local image 
 store and hosting from Picasa.  If you want to host your images from Picasa (to 
 save the data API cost) you need to also download the gdata and supporting libraries. 
 I've automated this in a script: @dev/gdata-install.sh@.  Note that it must be run 
 from your bloog base directory.  The script will download and extract the necessary 
 files into your bloog project.
 
Next, you need to determine what album you want to upload images to.  Picasa can 
 automatically use an album named 'default.'  However, if you want to use some 
 other Picasa album that you've created, you need to determine that album's ID.  
 Edit @dev/scripts/picasa_get_album_id.py@ (inserting your user name and the name
 of the album you've created).  The script will spit out that album's ID, and also
 list the photos already present in that album (as a sanity check to make sure 
 that album is publicly accessible).  Then take that album ID number and put it 
 in the 'picasa_auth_info' section in @config.py@.
 

h2. Deploying to AppEngine

Change the @application@ name in app.yaml, and upload your app:

bc.  $ appcfg.py update .

For more information on AppEngine, see the 
 "Getting Started documentation":http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/ .
